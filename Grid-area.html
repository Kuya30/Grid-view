                    This page shares my best <i style="color:red">articles</i> to read on topics like health,
                    happiness, creativity, productivity and more.
                    The central question that drives my work is, “How can we live better?” To answer that question,
                    I like to write about science-based ways to solve practical problems.

                <b>Video</b> is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting,
                and display of moving visual media.[1] Video was first developed for mechanical television systems,
                which were quickly replaced by cathode-ray tube (CRT) systems which, in turn,
                were replaced by flat panel displays of several types.
